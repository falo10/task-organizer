Welcome to Task Organizer by falo10

I encourage you to use the code freely!

PYTHON 3.10.4 was used to write the code, so I encourage you to update your version if you want the program to work properly.
The program saves the data in a database named databaseTO.db - use SQLite (3.12 recommended) to open the file!
